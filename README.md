# rjsform
jQuery widget for JavaScript form management

This page will be added in the future - for now, examine the demo page in the master branch to see how this works.

## Branches
- dev: development branch, unstable.
- master: release branch, stable. Versions will be tagged here.
- deploy: deployment branch, stable. This branch will always be in sync with master, but will only contain the rjsform.js file. Suitable for adding as a submodule in another project.
